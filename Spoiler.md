The reason the evil host works the way it does, is that he ONLY swaps if you pick the correct door on the first try.
This, intuitively, is why I don't like the idea that you should always swap.
The problem assumes that the host will always reveal another door, and if he does, then yes, swapping yields the prize two thirds of the time.
But when he only swaps when you choose the right door, then swapping yields the correct door 0% of the time.
In the contrived repeated example I made, it's obvious that he doesn't offer to swap if you're incorrect, but in the original game when all you have is that one trial,
there's no guarantee that he was going to swap no matter what. This is my personal problem with the Monty Hall Problem.
Hope you enjoyed this little game.
